# Splunk SIEM — Enterprise Security Monitoring & SOC Visibility

**Project Owner:** Unnati Pandya  
**Tooling:** Splunk Enterprise (SIEM)

This project analyzes how Splunk improves security posture, enhances SOC visibility, and supports continuous monitoring for modern enterprise environments.

The project presentation explains:
- SIEM fundamentals
- Splunk architecture
- Core features supporting security teams
- Real-time monitoring and threat analysis
- How splunk asisted SOC operations
- Practical use case of log ingestion, dashboards, and correlation
  
## Overview

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platforms collect and analyze logs from different sources.
This project focuses on Splunk, which is a scalable SIEM Tool used by security teams to detect, visualize and respond to threats.

## The Analysis covers:
- Threat detection& incident response
- Continous monitoring & anomaly detection
- Log ingestion from Cloud, databases, endpoints, and applications
- Data visualization & dashboards
- Events correlation for SOC use cases


  ## Why Splunk?

  Splunk was selected due to:

  - **Real-time monitoring**
  - **Advanced search queries**
  - **Dynamic thershold-based alerts**
  - **Cloud / Hybrid / On-premises support**
  - **High scalability with large datasets**
  - **Strong add-on & integration ecosystem**
 

  ## How Splunk Works

  Splunk ingestion Pipeline:

1. **Collects logs** from multiple sources
2. **Indexes & correlates** security
3. **Analyzes patterns** for anomalies
4. **Visualizes trends** via dashbords
5. **Genertaes alerts** for SOC teams

This enables analysts to:
- Detect abnormal behavior
- Identify unauthorized access
- Investigate Incidents
- Automate response workflows

  ## Key Project Learnings

  - SIEM enhances enterprise-wide security visibility
  - Splunk enables predictive and anomaly-based insights
  - Even raw logs become actionable itteligence for SOCs
  - Monitoring + analytics = core of cyber defense
